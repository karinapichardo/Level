hotel / travel website built using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript

### *This project taught me a ton and was fun to create...*
I learned how to incorporate svgs into forms / manipulate them, and I learned more about the power of JavaScript. 

I  was able to incorporate JS into different components of my website.

In this project I was able to create a hamburger menu with JavaScript which was neat. I also added a cool scroll animation using JavaScript, as well as creating an active state for my navigation links with JS.

I’m learning about the limitations of CSS, although awesome, there’s a lot that you can easily do with JavaScript. So I look forward to continuing to use both! 

I practiced working with videos and images as backgrounds. 

Likewise, I practiced using flex box and CSS grid - a major plus!

### *The biggest thing that this project really got me pondering about was responsive design...*

how targeting devices / styling for specific devices, is probably not ideal or best practice.

While it’s crucial for a website to look good on every device, it’s equally important to target breakpoints based on when your design fails vs the size of a specific mobile device, for example. 

With that being said, I’m super excited to continue to learn more about responsive design, and how to use media queries and other techniques more efficiently because I truly am seeing the importance of it.
